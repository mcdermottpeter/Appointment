Implement a superclass Appointment and sub classes OneTime, Day and Month. 
An Appointment has a description (for example, “Pull Teeth”) and a date. 
Write a method OccurrsOn (int year, int month, int day) that checks whether the appointment occurs on that date.
For example, for checking on month, you must check whether the month matches from a pool of existing appointments. 
You will also need to prefill an array of appointments with the Appointment objects and your code is simply checking against them. 
Have the user enter a date to check, and you should display them once the appointment matched.
